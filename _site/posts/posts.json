my personal interest, I have restricted my dataset to capture only 3 indicators, those are Country name, Life Expectancy (in years) and year of observation.\r\nNote:\r\nThis is article is limited on visualizing Life Expectancy among the 5 EAC countries, those are Burundi, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania.\r\nThe period of interest range between 1960 and 2019\r\nAs the below plot, Kenya has been ahead until replaced by Rwanda in 2000s on level of Life Expectancy among EAC countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComparing EAC countries’ life expectancy by using dumbbel by using ggalt package\r\nIn the following plot, I have shown the change in Life Expectancy between 1960 and 2019 (taking only two individual years). Rwanda is the first country with the highest increase in Life Expectancy by considering countries records in both 1960 and 2019, Kenya being the Second countries on record has been on good track before being replaced by Rwanda. Tanzania is the Third followed by Uganda and Burundi respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Conclusion\r\nWhen comparing countries’ Life Expectancy in 1960 versus that of 2019, EAC countries’ Life Expectancy have increased as the following:\r\nRwanda: 26.41 years (being the first country with highest increase and is the one which has the highest Life Expectancy as of 2019 with 69.024 years)\r\nTanzania: 21.86 years\r\nBurundi: 20.3 years\r\nKenya: 19.94 years (being the second country with highest life Expectancy as of 2019)\r\nUganda: 19.01 years\r\nGenerally, Life Expectancy among EAC countries has been rising between 1960 and 2019, this is might be attributed to the improvement in security within these countries, Policies in place, etc.\r\nSources:\r\nWorld Bank Data, accessed through WDI package;\r\nbbplot package developed by BBC data reporting team;\r\nfurther notes on the alignment used within this Rmarkdown document, kindly refer to this link\r\nFuture interactions\r\nShould you seek any further interactions with me, kindly find more details about me in the About tab in the top-right corner of this blog.\r\nThank you for having interest in my blog post.
